# Web Socket Example

This flow creates a simple web page at 'http://{your-server-ip:1880/simple'

The web page then connects back to the server using a websocket and receives time updates every 5 seconds and updates the web page with that information.

There is also a simple button to push a message back to the server - which will appear in the debug.
